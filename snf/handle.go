// mandatory; if omitted default settings will be applied.
//
// portnum can be interpreted as an integer for a specific port number
// or as a mask when AggregatePortMask is specified in flags option.
// Port information can be obtained through GetIfAddrs() and
// active/valid masks are available with PortMask() method. As a
// special case, if portnum -1 is passed, the library will internally
// open a portmask as in valid mask returned in PortMask().

// Capture mode and the Ethernet driver stops receiving packets.  If
// successful, a call to Start() is required to the Sniffer-mode NIC
// to deliver packets to the host, and this call must occur after at
// least one ring is opened (OpenRing() method).

// Possible errors include:
//
// EBUSY: Device is already opened.
//
// EINVAL: Invalid argument passed, most probably num_rings (if not, check
// syslog).
//
// E2BIG: Driver could not allocate requested dataring_sz (check syslog).
//
// ENOMEM: Either library or driver did not have enough memory to allocate
// handle descriptors (but not data ring).

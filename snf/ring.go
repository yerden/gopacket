// Recv receives next packet from a receive ring.

// This function is used to return the next available packet in a
// receive ring.  The function can block indefinitely, for a specific
// timeout or be used as a non-blocking call with a timeout of 0.
//
// timeout is a receive timeout to control how the function blocks for
// the next packet. If the value is less than 0, the function can
// block indefinitely.  If the value is 0, the function is guaranteed
// to never enter a blocking state and returns EAGAIN unless there is
// a packet waiting.  If the value is greater than 0, the caller
// indicates a desired wait time in milliseconds.  With a non-zero
// wait time, the function only blocks if there are no outstanding
// packets.  If the timeout expires before a packet can be received,
// the function returns EAGAIN (and not ETIMEDOUT).  In all cases,
// users should expect that the function may return EINTR as the
// result of signal delivery.
//
// req is a Receive Packet structure, only updated when the function
// returns 0 for a successful packet receive (RecvReq).
//
// Return values: nil is a successful packet delivery, req is updated
// with packet information. EINTR means the call was interrupted by a
// signal handler. EAGAIN means that no packets are available (only
// when timeout is >= 0).
//
// The returned packet always points directly into the receive ring
// where the NIC has DMAed the packet (there are no copies).  As such,
// the user obtains a pointer to library/driver allocated memory.
// Users can modify the contents of the packets but should remain
// within the slice boundaries.
//
// Upon calling the function, the library assumes that the user is
// done processing the previous packet.  The same assumption is made
// when the ring is closed (ring's Close() method).
